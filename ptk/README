This library provides wrappers for part of the MPI library
using fortran 90 features, expecially the overloading procedure.
Every (implemented) mpi call is translated in an equivalent
ptk call where the arguments concerning sizes and kinds are omitted.

As an example:

call MPI_Bcast(buffer,10,MPI_INTEGER,root,comm,ierr)

becomes:

call ptk_bcast(buffer,root,comm,ierr)

Also, part of the arguments are usually
optional with reasonable default values.
Finally, other extra tools are implemented.
See the source code for details.
