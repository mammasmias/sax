\SAX was originally a project of the
National Research Center on nanoStructures and bioSystems at Surfaces (S3)
of the Italian INFM-CNR (http://www.s3.infm.it), based in Modena, Italy.
Most of the recent developments have been supported by CEA-DIF (France).

The computer time and specific technical support is partly provided by CINECA through ISCRA projects and by CINES through GENCI projects.

The scientific board of the SaX project is composed by
Layla Martin-Samos, Giovanni Bussi, Alice Ruini,
Marilia J. Caldas and Elisa Molinari.

The present release of SaX has been realized by Layla Martin-Samos and Giovanni Bussi.
A list of contributors include Chiara Campani (implementation of memory.x) and
Leonardo Matheus Marion Jorge (implementation of postprocessing tools as DOS and bands).
