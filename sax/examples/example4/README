Description: GW calculation on a PA chain for different
k point sampling

Output:
	- sigma_x.ik contains the exchange part of the
	self-energy operator in xml format
	-sigma_c.ik contains the correlation part of the
	self-energy operator in xml format
	-GW_QP continains the quasi-particle energies
	as a functions of the k points in xml format

Suggestions: 
	-This exmaple is made to show how to solve the coulomb
	divergencies in 1D systems, we suggest to try to
	change the coulomb_div_treatment="cutoff_ws" with
	coulomb_div_treatment="cutoff_spherical" and
	rerun the scritp.
