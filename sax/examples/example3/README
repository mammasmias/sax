Description: GW calculation using plasmon-pole model for bulk silicon without
             diagonalization of the quasi-particle hamiltonian (states remain DFT states)
             BSE calculation starting from GW states  (GW energies but DFT states)
             RPA calculation including excitonic effects, starting from GW states
             of the macroscopic dielectric tensor projected on the (1.0 0.0 0.0) q-direction
             for bulk silicon
Comment: here a standard trick is used. As the kpoint mesh is in the reducible BZ
         the use of shifted kpoint grid usually gives more non equivalent kpoints in the
         irreducible BZ than a grid centered at gamma point. The screening in GW depends only
         on the q vector (k-k'). The screening is calculated with a shifted grid (to got a more 
         converge screening in the sense of BZ sampling) but the QP
         Hamiltonian with a gamma centered grid (to have the gap at gamma).
Output:
   -states contains in xml binary format the DFT states
   -epsilon.static contains in xml format the macroscopic dielectric tensor
    for w=0 including local field effects
   -polar contains in xml binary format the polarizability
   -w.smooth contains in xml binary format the screening potential
   -pp_parameters contains in xml binary format the plasmon pole parameters
   -GW_QP contains GW eigenvalues and eigenstates
   -GW_states contains energies and wave functions
   -sigma_c.ik correlation part of the self-energy for k-point index ik
   -dsigma_c.ik derivative of correlation part of the self-energy for
    kpoint index ik
   -sigma_x.ik exchange part of the self-energy for kpoint index ik
   -bse excitonic energies and excitonic waves function on the GW states basis
   -epsilon.RPAEXC contains in xml format the full (3*3) macroscopic
    dielectric tensor including excitonic effects
   -repsilon.RPAEXC contains the real part of the macroscopic
    dielectric tensor projected on (1.0 0.0 0.0) q direction as a function of energy (Ry)
   -oas.RPAEXC contains format the simulated optical absorption spectra
    on (1.0 0.0 0.0) q direction as a function of energy (Ry)
   -eels.RPAEXC contains format the electron energy loss spectra for q->0
    in the (1.0 0.0 0.0) direction
Suggestions:
   -1) In the spectra input, change calculation_kind="RPA" and compare the resulting
    spectra with previous one
   -2) To have the GW corrections to the self-energy for a kpoint grid containing gamma
    you can first perform the same calculations but with a non-shifted grid ->
       -use PWN_INPUT for pwscf calculation
       -change everywhere in sax's input for kmesh object : shift="0.0 0.0 0.0"
   -3) As kpoint grid containing gamma some times for symmetry reasons have less non-equivalent
    kpoints than those shifted, Calculate first, the screening with the shifted mesh 
    (with shifted pwscf grid too)
       -calc_polarizability="T", calc_pp_parameters="T", calc_w="T".
       -then rerun pwscf with non shifted grid, and gw with non shifted grid but asking just
        to calc the energies: calc_polarizability="F", calc_w="F", calc_pp_parameters="F",
        calc_energies="T",calc_sigma_x="T", calc_sigma_c="T",calc_sp_hmatrix="T".
        
        Compare GW_QP energies found in 2) with those found in 3). Compare epsilon.static
        found in 2) with the one found in 3) with experimental value.

In the /reference directory the user can find the textual main output of the example1
run. The calculations have been performed with a pc and the g95 fortran compiler.
