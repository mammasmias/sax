SaX is an open-source GNU General Public License package for the calculation of
electronic and optical properties, originally developed at the national Research Center on nanoStructures and bioSystems at Surfaces (S3)
of the Italian INFM-CNR (http://www.s3.infm.it) under the coordination
of Layla Martin-Samos and Giovanni Bussi. 

SaX works in the framework of many-body perturbation theory
in the GW approximation. This is the state-of-the-art method to describe
electronic band structures and excitonic effects beyond the 
density-functional theory (DFT), and in the last years
it has proved to be a successful approach for a wide range of materials.
SaX implements the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation using periodic cells, plane-waves and
pseudopotentials, and the various matrix elements are calculated on
real-space grids through fast-Fourier transforms. Depending on the
available computational resources, SaX can be used to study
systems with large cells (up to 1000 A^3) and large number of atoms
(up to 100).

The SaX package is written in Fortran90 and designed in a modern way,
taking advantage of an object-oriented structure.
The low-level operations are hidden inside object-libraries
which defines plane-waves grids, wavefunctions, etc.
The modularity of the code simplifies greatly the higher level implementation.
For this reason, SaX is a perfect tool
for methodological research. On the other side, the efficiency
of the code is tight to the efficiency of the low-level 
routines, which can be optimized (and are already fairly optimized)
independently.

The SaX package operates, in principles, as a post-processing of
any DFT electronic structure code. In the present version, the user will
find a wrapper to run SaX from the results of DFT calculations
done using PWSCF code included in the quantum-espresso 
distribution (www.quantum-espresso.org).

SaX calculations will provide the user with:

* Full dynamical structure of the random-phase-approximation polarizability.
* Quasiparticle energies and wavefunctions.
* Different implementations of GW scheme.
* Different degrees of self-consistency in the GW scheme.
* Excitonic effects with the Bethe-Salpeter equation.

Current limitations (and planned developments):

* Metallic systems can not be treated properly.
* Symmetries are not taken into account.
